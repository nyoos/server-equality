hamming_weight = 1 | noise budget of query result: 39

hamming_weight = 5 | Noise budget of query result: exceeded

As expected, multiplicative depth of calculating the selection vector increases and noise consumption increases when hamming weight increases past a power of 2. 
(weight 3 and 4 have similar noise consumptions)
